    "\n",
    "This tutorial gives a brief introduction into using ipywidgets in jupyter notebooks. Ipywidgets provide a set of building blocks for graphical user interfaces that are powerful, yet easy to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple use case could be, adding some basic controls to a plot for interactive data exploration. On the other side of the spectrum, we can combine widgets together to build full-fledged graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we first introduce the `interact` function, which is a convenient way to quickly create suitable widgets to control functions. Second, we look into specific widgets, and stack them together to build a basic gui application. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook used for this tutorial is available on [github](https://github.com/Kapernikov/ipywidgets-tutorial), together with a link to a live version on [binder](https://mybinder.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the notebook locally, the very first requirement is a working jupyter environment. Setting up an installation lies outside the scope of the tutorial, but can be found in the official [docs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Note that for this tutorial all libraries were installed using pip, or the pacman package manager. Anaconda (at least on windows 10) currently has a matplotlib issue that gives some problems. Therefore, if you have problems displaying plots correctly, try using pip only, or linux. The examples were tested on Windows 10 and Arch Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "The versions of packages explicitly used to create the examples are:\n",
    " * python 3.8.1\n",
    " * matplotlib 3.1.3\n",
    " * numpy 1.18.1\n",
    " * ipywidgets 7.5.1\n",
    " * ipympl 0.4.1\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started we set the ipympl backend, which makes matplotlib plots interactive. We do this using a [magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html), starting with %.  We also import some libraries: [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for plotting, [numpy](https://numpy.org/) to generate data, and [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for obvious reasons."
